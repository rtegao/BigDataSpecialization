# BigDataSpecialization
Repository for the final activity of a Big Data Specialization course

## Project Description
The main ideia os the project is to work with big data tools, such as Hadoop and Pyspark, with dataset with large amount of data.

### Data Base
The data was provided by the Air Sofia (https://airsofia.info/) at the Kaggle plataform (https://www.kaggle.com/hmavrodiev/sofia-air-quality-dataset).
The data are based on scattered sensor that are capable to mesure the pressure, temperature and humidity with an update 1 second. The date range is two years, from 07/2017 to 07/2019.

### Machine Learning Algorithm
One possible application is to build forecast algorithm for futures levels of pressure, temperature and humidity. Howerver, there are a thousands of sensors in differents positions, this make impossible to predict this number of time series.
To solve this issue, it's possible to cluster differents time series with the intention to reduce the numbers of differents algorithms that are necessaty to build.
In summary, this project will cluster differents time series with Big Data Frameworks.
